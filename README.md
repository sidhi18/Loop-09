📌 Overview

This project contains multiple pattern printing programs written in Java using loops.
These are common beginner-level exercises that improve logic building and nested loop understanding.

🚀 Programs Included
1️⃣ Solid Rectangle

Prints a rectangle filled with *.

2️⃣ Hollow Rectangle

Prints a rectangle with * only at the borders, leaving the inside empty.

3️⃣ Half Pyramid (Right-angled Triangle)

Star pattern aligned to the left side.

4️⃣ Inverted Half Pyramid

Reverse of the half pyramid (stars decrease each row).

5️⃣ Inverted Half Pyramid (180° Rotated)

Stars aligned to the right side.

6️⃣ Inverse Inverted Half Pyramid (180°)

Reverse of the above right-aligned pyramid.

7️⃣ Number Pyramid

Increasing numbers in a pyramid shape.

Also includes the Inverse Number Pyramid.

8️⃣ Floyd’s Triangle

Sequential numbers arranged in a triangular format.

9️⃣ 0–1 Triangle

Binary triangle where each position is filled with 0 or 1 depending on the row+column sum (even → 1, odd → 0).

🎯 Learning Outcomes

Understanding nested loops in Java.

Difference between row control and column control loops.

How to handle spacing and alignment in patterns.

Applying conditions inside loops for hollow vs filled shapes.

🖥️ How to Run

Clone or download this repository.

Open any .java file (e.g., Loops_09.java) in your IDE (IntelliJ, VS Code, Eclipse).

Compile and run using:

javac Loops_09.java
java Loops_09


Observe the output pattern printed on the console.

✅ Future Scope

Add alphabet patterns (A, B, C, etc.).

Add diamond / rhombus / butterfly patterns.

Extend to advanced designs using functions.
